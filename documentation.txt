📌 Multispectral Satellite Image Dehazing System
Objective:
Develop a system that dehazes satellite images, classifies them for relevance, and provides alerts based on NO₂ pollution analysis using an LLM (Transformer-based offline model).

1️⃣ System Architecture
🛠 Components:
✔ Data Input: User uploads a hazy satellite image (JPG/PNG).
✔ Image Validation: A CNN classifier rejects non-satellite images.
✔ Dehazing Model: Uses CycleGAN + CNN Autoencoder to process the image.
✔ Pollution Data Extraction: Fetches NO₂, PM2.5, AOD levels based on location.
✔ LLM Alert System: Generates a detailed report and provides alerts if necessary.
✔ Django Web App: Hosts the model and allows users to upload/download processed images.

🔗 Workflow Overview:
1️⃣ User Uploads Image → 2️⃣ Image Validation → 3️⃣ Dehazing Model Processes Image → 4️⃣ Pollution Data Retrieved → 5️⃣ LLM Generates Alert & Report → 6️⃣ Downloadable PDF Output

2️⃣ Data Processing Pipeline
🔹 2.1 Dataset Collection
We will use two types of datasets:
✅ Paired Data (Supervised Learning)

Dataset with both hazy & clean images.
Used for training a CNN Autoencoder (Pix2Pix GAN or UNet-based model).
✅ Unpaired Data (Unsupervised Learning)
Dataset containing only hazy images (no clean reference).
Used for training a CycleGAN to learn dehazing transformations.
Sources:

Paired: RESIDE Dataset, DENSE-HAZE Dataset
Unpaired: Real-world satellite images with haze
🔹 2.2 Image Preprocessing
Before training, we apply:
✔ Resizing to a fixed resolution (e.g., 256×256 or 512×512).
✔ Normalization (Pixel values scaled to [0,1] or [-1,1] for GANs).
✔ Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance contrast.
✔ Data Augmentation: Rotation, Scaling, and Flipping to prevent overfitting.

🔹 2.3 Feature Engineering
✔ Extract Haze Features:

Estimate haze density using Dark Channel Prior (DCP).
Compute Transmission Map (TM) to estimate how much haze covers the image.
✔ Extract Pollution-Related Features:
Location-based NO₂, PM2.5, AOD levels.
Compare haze density with pollution levels for better insights.
3️⃣ Model Selection & Training
🔹 3.1 CycleGAN for Unpaired Data (Unsupervised Learning)
Why?
✅ Learns hazy → clean mapping without paired images.
✅ Uses Generator (G) and Discriminator (D) networks.
✅ Maintains structural consistency using Cycle Consistency Loss.

Training Strategy:
✔ Generator learns haze removal.
✔ Discriminator ensures realistic outputs.
✔ Uses Adversarial Loss + Cycle Consistency Loss.

🔹 3.2 CNN Autoencoder for Paired Data (Supervised Learning)
Why?
✅ Learns precise hazy → clean mapping using L1 + SSIM Loss.
✅ Fine-tuned with CycleGAN dehazed outputs for better generalization.

Architecture:
✔ Encoder (Extracts Haze Features).
✔ Bottleneck (Compresses Information).
✔ Decoder (Reconstructs Clean Image).

🔹 3.3 Hybrid Training Strategy
1️⃣ Train CycleGAN first on unpaired data.
2️⃣ Use CycleGAN’s output to pre-train the CNN Autoencoder.
3️⃣ Fine-tune CNN Autoencoder with paired data for best results.

4️⃣ Image Classification (Input Validation)
A CNN-based image classifier ensures only satellite images are processed.

✔ Trained on:

Satellite images (Positive Samples).
Regular photos (Negative Samples).
✔ If an image is not a satellite image, the system rejects it and sends an alert.
5️⃣ Pollution Analysis & LLM Integration
🔹 5.1 Extracting NO₂ Pollution Data
✔ Fetch NO₂, PM2.5, AOD values based on geolocation.
✔ Use a pre-collected dataset or API (if available).

🔹 5.2 Transformer-based LLM Alert System
Why?
✅ Offline Transformer Model (e.g., GPT-2, LLama 2, Falcon 7B).
✅ Processes pollution data + dehazed image metadata.
✅ Generates a human-readable alert for users.

Example LLM Outputs:
🟢 "Image successfully dehazed. NO₂ levels: Moderate (45µg/m³). No severe haze detected."
🔴 "NO₂ levels are dangerously high (120µg/m³). Severe air pollution detected in this region."

6️⃣ Deployment & Web Interface
🔹 6.1 Django Web App
Features:
✔ User uploads hazy satellite image.
✔ Backend processes it through dehazing models.
✔ LLM generates an alert.
✔ Final report is downloadable as PDF.

Tech Stack:
✅ Django (Backend)
✅ TensorFlow / PyTorch (For CNN & CycleGAN)
✅ Transformers (For LLM)
✅ PostgreSQL (Storing user images & metadata)

7️⃣ Final Output & Report Generation
📜 User Receives:
✅ Before vs. After Dehazing (Side-by-Side Comparison)
✅ Pollution Data (NO₂, PM2.5, AOD if available)
✅ Model Metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NIQE if needed)
✅ LLM-Generated Summary & Alert

📥 Output Format:
✔ Downloadable PDF Report
✔ Processed Image (JPG/PNG)

8️⃣ Future Enhancements
✔ Improve Image Quality with Super-Resolution.
✔ Integrate a Web-Based GIS System for Dynamic Visualization.
✔ Use Diffusion Models for Dehazing Instead of GANs.
✔ Develop a Mobile App for Field Use.

📌 Conclusion: Why This Approach?
✅ Combines both paired & unpaired data for best accuracy.
✅ Uses CNN Autoencoder & CycleGAN to leverage both datasets.
✅ Ensures only satellite images are processed with CNN validation.
✅ Enhances analysis with NO₂ & pollution insights.
✅ LLM adds explainability & alerts users about severe conditions.

🚀 Final Verdict: This is the most balanced & scalable approach.
